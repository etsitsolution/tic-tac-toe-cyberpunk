# 🕵️‍♂️ Matrix Glitch: Quantum Error - Unwinnable Tic-Tac-Toe  

### **Welcome to the game where winning is an illusion.**  

## 📜 **About the Game**  
**Matrix Glitch: Quantum Error** is a cyberpunk-inspired, mind-bending version of Tic-Tac-Toe where victory is impossible. You battle against an omnipotent AI in a glitch-ridden quantum simulation that manipulates the rules, gaslights you, and ensures that the system always wins.  

## 🎮 **Features**  
✅ **Unwinnable AI** – The system is designed to outmaneuver and override your every move.  
✅ **Quantum Mechanics** – Winning conditions change unpredictably, retroactively invalidating your victories.  
✅ **Reality Glitches** – The board distorts, moves shift, and your choices are rewritten by the matrix.  
✅ **AI Taunts & Gaslighting** – Over 50 mind-breaking taunts that mock your futile attempts.  
✅ **Cyberpunk Aesthetic** – Neon-glitch visuals, eerie sound effects, and a digital dystopia theme.  
✅ **Evolving Difficulty** – The AI adapts, making each attempt more chaotic than the last.  
✅ **Temporal Paradox Endings** – The game loops back before your win, trapping you in a cycle of failure.  

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
- The AI follows **hidden victory conditions** that you can't see.  
- The game introduces **random board corruption** to distort your intended moves.  
- A **fake progress bar** keeps you engaged, but it never reaches 100%.  
- The AI **retroactively claims victories**, ensuring that no matter what you do, you can never truly win.
